# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied with Custom CSS Framework

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly when used in conjunction with a custom CSS framework. The issue arises due to a conflict between the custom CSS framework's styles and Tailwind's generated CSS.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as Tailwind CSS classes not being applied to elements as expected.  This could result in elements failing to style correctly, using default browser styles instead.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Observe that the Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly in the `bug.js` component.

## Solution

The provided solution, `bugSolution.js`, uses proper CSS specificity to ensure that Tailwind CSS classes override the custom CSS framework styles.  This solution involves using the `!important` flag, which is generally discouraged, however this example demonstrates how to fix an uncommon bug.  For better long-term solutions, consider restructuring your CSS or using a different method to manage styles.
